Chip 8 Emulator Written in C++

This is my first project using C++. It is an emulator/bytecode interpreter for the Chip 8 computer for UNIX-like operating systems. 
Simply compile using make and run with ./(binary name) (rom name, ex. ibm.ch8) This emulator is not yet completed, and will probably not be any time soon. Just a fun side project for me to learn about how computers operate.
